# Hey There!

I am Akash Joshi, a writer, programmer and content creator with 5 years of experience. I like to solve my own problems using code wherever possible. For eg, check out the [Telegram bot](https://github.com/akash-joshi/madulus) I use to automate my life. I've also built a [JSON Editor & Transformer](https://github.com/akash-joshi/json-transformer) to solve my own Data transformation needs.

I also write articles on things I think there needs to be more information about. For eg, recently I broke down the [React rendering tips](https://thewriting.dev/revisiting-react-rendering/) for beginners, which I think should be taught in React tutorials.
